\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\subsection{Urban challenges}

Growing urban populations present a challenge to urban planners, policy makers, and urban residents. World-wide, populations of cities have been growing while population densities fall and urban footprints grow \citep{Roberts2007}. In Australia, Melbourne is expected to grow from 4.5 to 8 million residents by 2051 and will need 1.6 million new homes to accommodate this growth \citep{VictoriaStateGovernment2017}. While governments have tried to contain urban sprawl by encouraging densification of cities, planning and growth continues to convert and develop greenspace on the urban fringes into urban growth areas \citep{GrowthAreasAuthority2009}.

This urban development amplifies existing problems of urban heat. Vegetation and natural surfaces are replaced with impervious surfaces with high heat storage capacity. The removal of vegetation and alteration of the water cycle (increased run-off and reduced infiltration) creates drier and less shaded areas. The combination of these can lead to an urban heat island (UHI) effect in which urban areas are significantly warmer (especially at night) than surrounding rural areas (i.e. the areas the greenfill developments replaced) \citep{Coutts2010,Oke1982}. Further, the frequency and intensity of heatwaves is projected to increase under climate change \citep{Alexander2009}, magnifying the effects of UHI \citep{Rogers2018}, in already vulnerable highly populated areas \citep{Lemonsu2015}.

\subsection{Impacts of increased urban heat}
Increased urban heat (and the magnifying impacts of UHI and heat waves) have far ranging impacts on the health and well being of urban residents. Heat causes significant increases in mortality and morbidity as daily temperatures cross threshold temperatures \citep{Nicholls2008}. Suicides increase as cities heat up \citep{Burke2018a} and learning in school-aged children is impacted negatively \citep{Goodman2018}. Levels of physical activity decrease as the walkability of areas reduce due to decreased human thermal comfort (HTC) and lack of shading vegetation canopies \citep{Millington2009,Gallin2001,LSA2003}. This physical inactivity brings with it poor public health outcomes and increased strain on public health systems  \citep{Davison2008,Lee2008b,Warburton2006,WHO2010}.



Climate sensitive urban design (\glssymbol{csud}) has been proposed as an intervention (and guiding design principle) to help address urban heat \citep{Coutts2012,Oke2017}. It incorporates water sensitive urban design (\glssymbol{wsud}) \citep{Wong2009} to provide water to support increased urban vegetation, increasing human thermal comfort, mitigating UHI and heat wave health issues \citep{Bowler2010}. Evaluating how much potential cooling benefits CSUD can provide (including HTC), especially in newly developed greenfill sites, has been little studied up to this point.

\subsection{Evaluating the benefits of climate sensitive urban design}
Quantifying the cooling potential of CSUD/WSUD requires a tool. The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool (TARGET) model \citep{Broadbent2018} is a model designed to be efficient and accessible while providing accurate calculations of urban surface temperatures and street level air temperature at micro-to-local scales. 

The model has been designed specifically to assess the cooling effects of the green/blue (urban vegetation and water) infrastructure provided by CSUD. TARGET's efficiency means that modelling domains of tens of thousands of grid points can calculate weeks worth of simulation in seconds to minutes. The accessibility allows modelling scenarios to be created from simple land cover class fractions and a few basic parameters.

However TARGET v1.0 previously could only calculate surface and air temperatures. As part of this study, the ability to calculate human thermal comfort indexes, specifically \glssymbol{UTCI} as well as the mean radiant temperature \glssymbol{Tmrt} needed to calculate \glssymbol{UTCI} were added to TARGET and evaluated for suitability to accurately model CSUD.

\subsection{Research aims}
The main aims of this study are the following: 1) can the TARGET model accurately predict (spatially and temporally) HTC in a variety of urban street canyons? and 2) what is the potential for CSUD/WSUD for urban cooling and positive impacts on HTC at a precinct and micro-climate scale?




\section{Methods}\label{sec:Methods}



\subsection{Addition of mean radiant temperature and Universal Thermal Climate Index calculations to TARGET}\label{sec:tmrtutci}

Calculations for HTC have been added to the TARGET model \citep{Broadbent2018}. Complete descriptions of these calculations are detailed in \cite{Nice2018} but will be described briefly here.

Using TARGET calculated values of canyon air temperature, \glssymbol{Tcan}, street level wind speed, canyon surface temperatures, \glssymbol{Tsurf}, and upward longwave with forcing values of downward shortwave and longwave and vapour pressure, the values for mean radiant temperature (\glssymbol{Tmrt}) and the human thermal comfort index UTCI are calculated for each grid square.

Calculations of \glssymbol{Tmrt} (\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) uses a two step procedure. First, globe temperature (\glssymbol{Tg}) is calculated by an iterative relaxation solution, using a formulation of \cite{Liljegren2008} in  

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tg2}
\begin{split}
\glssymbol{A}\glssymbol{epsilong}\glssymbol{sigma} \glssymbol{Tg}^{4} &= \frac{\glssymbol{A}}{2} \glssymbol{epsilong}\glssymbol{sigma}(\glssymbol{epsilona} \glssymbol{Ta}^{4} +  \glssymbol{epsilonsfc} \glssymbol{Tsfc}^{4} ) \\
&+ \frac{\glssymbol{A}}{2}( 1-\glssymbol{alphag})(1-\glssymbol{fdir})\glssymbol{S}  \\
&+ \frac{\glssymbol{A}}{4}( 1-\glssymbol{alphag})\glssymbol{fdir}\glssymbol{S} /\cos(\glssymbol{theta}) \\
&+ \frac{\glssymbol{A}}{2}( 1-\glssymbol{alphag})\glssymbol{alphasfc}\glssymbol{S} \\
&- \glssymbol{A}\glssymbol{h}(\glssymbol{Tg}-\glssymbol{Ta})   
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where \glssymbol{A}, is the \glsdesc{A},
\glssymbol{epsilona}, the \glsdesc{epsilona}, 
\glssymbol{epsilong}, the \glsdesc{epsilong}, 
\glssymbol{epsilonsfc}, the \glsdesc{epsilonsfc}, 
\glssymbol{epsilong}, the \glsdesc{epsilong}, 
\glssymbol{h}, the \glsdesc{h}, 
\glssymbol{Ta}, the \glsdesc{Ta} (using \glssymbol{Tcan}), 
\glssymbol{Tsfc}, the surface temperature (K), 
\glssymbol{S}, the \glsdesc{S}, 
\glssymbol{sigma}, the \glsdesc{sigma}, 
\glssymbol{theta}, the \glsdesc{theta}, 
\glssymbol{alphasfc}, the \glsdesc{alphasfc},  
\glssymbol{alphag}, the globe albedo (of value 0.05), and 
\glssymbol{fdir}, the \glsdesc{fdir}. 

Using \glssymbol{Tg}, calculated in Equation (\ref{eq:tg2}), the second step in calculating \glssymbol{Tmrt} proceeds in a formulation of \cite{Kantor2011} 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tmrtbucket}
  \glssymbol{Tmrt} = 
  \bigg(
   (\glssymbol{Tg}+273.15)^{4} + 
    \frac{1.1 \times 10^{8}  \glssymbol{wsCm}^{0.6}}{\glssymbol{epsilong}  \glssymbol{D}^{0.4}}
    \times 
     (\glssymbol{Tg}-\glssymbol{Ta})
    \bigg)^{0.25} - 273.15
\end{equation}
 where \glssymbol{wsCm} is the \glsdesc{wsCm}.

Finally, the Universal Thermal Climate Index (\glssymbol{UTCI}) (\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) for each grid square is calculated using the \cite{Brode2009u} \glssymbol{UTCI} formula. The calculation uses modelled outputs of air temperature, wind speed (using model calculated wind speed at canyon level), relative humidity (from the forcing data), and $T_{mrt}$ (calculated above).

\subsection{Evaluation of \glssymbol{UTCI} calculations}\label{sec:methods_eval}

An evaluation of the new \glssymbol{UTCI} and \glssymbol{Tmrt} calculations was performed using observations of \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} recorded in George St. and Gipps St. in the City of Melbourne \citep{Coutts2015}. The evaluation procedure repeats the procedure fully described in Section 3.2.1 of \cite{Nice2018} and Section 5.3 of \cite{Nice2016}. But briefly, observations in \cite{Coutts2015} were made of two contrasting street canyons, Gipps St. (designated OPN), a street with an open canopy (12\% plan area canopy cover), and George St. (designated TRD), a treed canyon (45\% plan area canopy cover). Seven stations in these two streets recorded air temperature, wind speed, humidity, incoming shortwave radiation, and black globe temperatures for 21 months in 2011-13. These readings were used to calculate the observed values of \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI}. 


Two TARGET scenarios were constructed (designated GeorgeEvaluation and GippsEvaluation) and run for 29 days from 1-29 February 2012, forced by the observations from the observation station OPN1. Overview of modelling area and observation station locations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:GeorgeGippsSt}. The period contained a number of hot days (see Figure \ref{fig:CoMtemp}) and no days with precipitation.

\end{figure}


Values used include air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Values for incoming longwave and air pressure are taken from Melbourne Airport observations (station 086282, Melbourne Airport) \citep{BOM2016b}. Values for incoming shortwave are taken from one minute solar observations (station 086282, Melbourne Airport) \citep{BOM2016}. Predicted values for \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} were extracted from the modelled output and compared to the same locations of the observations. Comparisons with the observations were performed using the \cite{Willmott1981} d index of agreement as well as calculating mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) statistics.




% For example, the introduction of flow requirements proposed under BPEM guidelines (investigated as part of scenario 3 proposed changes for IWM regulation) could be achieved through extensive stormwater harvesting or green infrastructure that promotes significant infiltration and evapotranspiration losses.  Climate, soils, terrain, availability of recycled water as an alternative water supply (and drivers for its use) etc. will influence the urban design outcomes and inform the optimal infrastructure arrangement to deliver each scenario.  
%  (Clause 56:07 of the Victorian Planning Provisions and 6 star building code).
% Proposed changes for IWM regulation: landscape features that could be used to deliver the anticipated changes to IWM regulation for both BPEM and Building Codes, along with any other expected regulatory changes.  This could include passively irrigated street trees, wetlands, evapotranspiration fields and 100% uptake of rainwater tanks used to irrigate private gardens (and toilet flushing).  




\subsection{WSUD scenarios}\label{sec:methods_wsudscenarios}
An aim of this study is to calculate the potential cooling from WSUD using a future greenfill suburb in north-western Melbourne. To achieve this, three WSUD land cover scenarios were designed for the north-western Melbourne suburb. Each scenario represents a differing level of WSUD infrastructure with Scenario 1 (designated NONE) containing no WSUD (the base case) and Scenario 3 (designated FUTURE) represents proposed changes to Clause 56:07, Integrated Water Management, of the Victoria Planning Provisions \citep{VictoriaStateGovernment2018}. The last scenario, Scenario 3 (designated MAX), is a scenario that tries to maximize the use of WSUD to hopefully obtain 2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} of cooling. The modelling domain for each Scenario is at a resolution of 30m with a total of 80,000 grid points being used to simulate the suburb. Scenario land covers are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sunburyScenarios} with the area of interest (AOI) highlighted with a black box. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

Area of interest (AOI) marked with black box. }    
 \label{fig:sunburyScenarios}  \label{fig:sunburyDiffScenarios} 
\end{figure} 

Each WSUD scenario (land cover fractions summarized in Table \ref{tab:parameters}) for the suburb is different due to the makeup of the urban surface, which is fed into the TARGET model. Land surface categories in TARGET include fractions of roof, road, concrete, water bodies, vegetation/trees, dry grass, and irrigated grass. The proportion of irrigated grass and vegetation are higher and dry grass fraction is lower in Scenario MAX compared to Scenario NONE due to more WSUD in the landscape. The average fractions of the land surface categories add up to more than 1 for the scenarios (Table \ref{tab:parameters}), but for each individual grid point, the sum of the fractions is 1. Differences in land cover between scenarios are shown in Figure  \ref{fig:sunburyDiffScenarios} and summarised in Table \ref{tab:parametersDiff}. Details of the area of interest (AOI) are shown in Figure  \ref{fig:sunburyScenariosAOI}.

\subsection{Climate Scenarios}\label{sec:methods_climate_scenarios}

Three different climate scenarios were developed to assess the effectiveness of WSUD under different summer conditions. These include a cool summer day, an average summer day, and an extreme summer day. Half hourly meteorological data from Melbourne Airport weather station (station 086282, Melbourne Airport) \citep{BOM2016b}, the closest weather station to the greenfill area, was used as forcing data for the TARGET model. The meteorological variables used were 2m air temperature (\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}), relative humidity (\%), wind speed (m s$^{-1}$), surface pressure (hPa), total shortwave radiation (W m$^{-2}$), and total longwave radiation (W m$^{-2}$) These are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sunburyforcing}. Three days for each climate scenario (designated Cool, Average and Extreme) were chosen for simulation due with high levels of clear skies to maximize the radiation exposure and heating trends, although there are a few instances in the data of low levels of shortwave during the daytimes. The dates simulated are in Table \ref{tab:dates}, where the Average and Extreme scenarios contain two of the same dates.

\section{Evaluation and scenario results and discussion}

\subsection{Evaluation of added TARGET \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} functionality}\label{sec:eval-htc}


Modelled predictions for the George St. observation locations (TRD2, TRD3, TRD4, and TRD5) and Gipps St. observation locations (OPN3, OPN4, and OPN5) were extracted from the results of the GeorgeEvaluation and GippsEvaluation scenarios and compared to the observations for those locations. These are presented in Figures \ref{fig:tmrteval} and \ref{fig:utcieval}. Statistical analysis (RMSE, MBE, MAE, and d index of agreement) for these four and three locations for \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} are summarised in Table \ref{tab:georgetmrt}.

Statistics for Gipps St., a street with an open canopy, show very similar results for each location, with d index of agreement values ranging from 0.922 to 0.927 for \glssymbol{Tmrt} and 0.951 to 0.955 for \glssymbol{UTCI}. George St. shows a slightly wider range of results with d index of agreement values ranging from 0.922 to 0.963 for \glssymbol{Tmrt} and 0.931 to 0.960 for \glssymbol{UTCI}. Slightly more accurate results for \glssymbol{Tmrt} for locations with morning shade and afternoon sun (TRD2 and TRD5) compared to the other locations with full sun. The most accurate predictions of \glssymbol{UTCI} were for TRD2, a location with more shading than the other TRD locations. 

Overall, the results show that the new HTC module in TARGET performs well is suitable to make HTC predictions for a variety of urban scenarios.

\subsection{Results of whole domain WSUD scenarios}\label{sec:whole_domain}
After the new functionality in the TARGET model has been evaluated to ensure accurate predictions, we turn to the results of the WSUD scenarios. 

The results of each of the scenarios were averaged across the entire 80,000 grid point domain for the 3 day modelling period. The difference in air temperature between WSUD Scenarios 1,3,4 and the control case Scenario 2, are shown for each climate scenario in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiff}. Scenario 3 produced the most cooling in each climate scenario compared to the base case of Scenario 2, followed by Scenario 4. This was unexpected and suggests that for the whole domain, the highest WSUD Scenario does not produce as much cooling throughout the three simulated days. However, the cooling produced in these simulations is extremely small, and may not be physical. There was no difference in temperature between Scenarios 1 and 2. 

Figure \ref{fig:diff_air_temp} shows differences in air temperature between the 4 WSUD scenarios for each of the 3 climate scenarios. As these are only averaged across the 80,000 grid point domain and not across the 3 day modelling period, they show larger differences at different times of the day. Averages at 2pm on the third day of the modelling period are summarized in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiff}. These still show modest temperature reductions (around 0.1 to 0.2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) but of an order of magnitude larger than those averaged across the entire modelling period. Some slight warming at night of Scenario 4 would have offset some of the daytime temperature reductions in the 3 day average.

\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/temperatures/SunburyAll}
\caption{\bf Differences in air temperatures (\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}) (averaged across 80,000 domain grid points) for a) Cool, b) Average, and c) Extreme climate scenarios over the 3 day modelling period. }

\end{figure} 


Overall, the WSUD implemented in Scenario 3 can reduce the 2m air temperature by 0.04\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during cool summer days, 0.03\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during average summer days and 0.03\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during extreme summer days, with larger temperature reductions of 0.1 to 0.2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during the hottest part of the day.




The noteworthy result is that WSUD is most effective across a diurnal cycle during a cool summer day. However, WSUD shows a good response during the hottest parts of the day and shows larger cooling differentials on the extreme and average days. To further investigate these results, simulations where the whole domain consists of one land surface category were performed for each climate scenario. This was to understand how each land surface type responded to the cool, average and extreme summer days.

In these scenarios (Figures \ref{fig:surface_air_temps}a and b), it can be seen that during the cool days there is a clear difference in air temperature between the warmest land surface categories: road, concrete, and dry grass. In contrast, during extreme days the differences are much smaller between the categories. We hypothesise that during extreme days every surface type is extremely hot regardless of whether it is irrigated grass or concrete, accounting for the smaller difference in temperature from the high WSUD scenario during extreme days.

 \label{fig:surface_air_temps} 
\end{figure} 


\subsection{A small representative urban portion}\label{sec:result_rep_urban}
Averaging results over the whole domain is not necessarily representative of what would be experienced by a resident of the suburb, particularly since a large portion of the modelling domain is surrounding grasslands. Therefore, we conducted an analysis on a small representative urban portion (designated area of interest (AOI)), of the domain (highlighted in orange in Figure \ref{fig:temp_diff_repre}), the results of which are discussed in this section. Also, all further results discussed in Section \ref{sec:results_htc} are from the AOI.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering   
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{images/fig2}
\caption{\bf The air temperature difference between Scenario 4 and Scenario 2 for the whole domain with the orange box indicating the small representative urban portion area of interest (AOI).}    
 \label{fig:temp_diff_repre} 
\end{figure}

The air temperature difference (averaged across the AOI during the three day scenario) between Scenarios 1, 3, and 4 and Scenario 2, the control case, are shown in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiffRep}. These results are much more significant and align with expectations that Scenario 4 would produce the most cooling, followed by Scenario 3. The policy goal of Scenario 3 produces cooling of \textasciitilde 0.1\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} for each climate scenario. However, the efficacy of Scenario 4 is highly dependent on the climate scenario, producing an average cooling of 0.5\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during the Cool Scenario, 0.4\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during the Average Scenario and 0.3\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during the Extreme Scenario. This follows the same logic from the previous section that the differences between each land surface category is larger during Cool summer days where WSUD can have a larger effect, but during Average and Extreme summer days all land surfaces (including vegetation and water) are warmer so it is harder for WSUD to create a cooling effect.


\begin{table}[!htbp]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



The timeseries plots of the area average air temperature for each WSUD scenario (Figure \ref{fig:timeseries_scenarios}) further show that Scenario 4 is more effective during cool summer days than Extreme summer days. The difference in temperature between the four WSUD Scenarios increases when averaging over the AOI, compared to the whole domain in Section \ref{sec:whole_domain}. This is because the WSUD interventions are more concentrated across the AOI and so the effects are more significant. In the previous section the majority of the domain is dry grasslands which dilutes the cooling. The average difference in temperature between the WSUD scenarios is largest during the day (Figure \ref{fig:timeseries_scenarios}) indicating that the daily average reduction in temperature in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiffRep} does not represent the diurnal effects of the cooling.

Another interesting finding is that WSUD is almost ineffectual at night (Figure \ref{fig:timeseries_scenarios}). This suggests that for reducing nighttime heat stress and improving human thermal comfort, these WSUD scenarios may not have the desired effect. Human thermal comfort outcomes will be discussed further in the next section.

\end{figure} 




\subsection{Human thermal comfort impacts of WSUD}\label{sec:results_htc}

With the additions to the TARGET model described in Section \ref{sec:tmrtutci}, TARGET is now able to output the Universal Thermal Climate Index (\glssymbol{UTCI}), a measure of how a person feels that accounts for temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and radiation through the mean radiant temperature. Using the \glssymbol{UTCI} gives further detail into how WSUD changes the environment for humans. For example, the temperature may be reduced due to irrigated grass but people may not feel the difference due to the added humidity, which can make an environment feel warmer to a person.

The average difference in \glssymbol{UTCI} between WSUD Scenarios 1, 3, and 4 and Scenario 2 for the three climate scenarios are shown in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiffRep2}. The reduction in \glssymbol{UTCI} (Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiffRep2}) is greater than the reduction in temperature in Table \ref{tab:scenarioDiffRep}. These results indicate that incorporating WSUD into the landscape (Scenario 4) is highly beneficial for increasing the cooling effect `felt' by humans. In terms of temperature, Scenario 4 cools by 0.51\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during a Cool summer day, but the \glssymbol{UTCI} shows that it ‘feels’ like cooling of 0.81\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}, meaning that WSUD is effective at cooling the environment and improving human thermal comfort. Scenario 3 (which incorporates less WSUD interventions than Scenario 4) also produces significant cooling in the \glssymbol{UTCI} with reductions of 0.22\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} during Cool summer days. As with the temperature, the efficacy of the cooling of the \glssymbol{UTCI} is dependent on the climate scenario where the Cool Scenario has the most cooling and the Extreme Scenario has the least cooling. 

The difference in \glssymbol{UTCI} between Scenarios 1 and 2 show that Scenario 1 (the no WSUD Scenario) is cooler than the control case of Scenario 2. This is a counter intuitive result as Scenario 1 would be expected to be warmer than Scenario 2. However, the differences between the land surfaces are very small (Table 1) where Scenario 2 is almost identical except more water. As such, the difference in \glssymbol{UTCI} between the two scenarios is not considered physical.

Scenario 4 was designed to produce 2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} of cooling and this is achieved when considering the spatial difference in \glssymbol{UTCI} compared to Scenario 2 at midday (Figure \ref{fig:fig4}). The 2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} of cooling is almost everywhere during the Cool Scenarios and less pervasive in the Average and Extreme Scenarios, but these results are still significant. A reduction in \glssymbol{UTCI} of 2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} has the potential to save many lives during summer \citep{Nicholls2008}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This study had two main aims. The first was to determine TARGET's suitability to model WSUD cooling potential by evaluating the model's ability to accurately predict temporal and spatial values of HTC in a variety of urban settings. The second was to quantify these cooling potentials in terms of HTC at a precinct and micro-climate scale.

The first aim was accomplished through the addition of \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} calculations to TARGET (Section \ref{sec:tmrtutci}) and the evaluation of this new functionality (Sections \ref{sec:methods_eval} and \ref{sec:eval-htc}). The evaluation showed that TARGET was suitable to model the HTC impacts of blue/green infrastructure. Statistical comparisons with observed values of \glssymbol{Tmrt} and \glssymbol{UTCI} in two streets in Melbourne with varying amounts of canopy cover showed good results. Index of agreement values ranged from 0.92 to 0.96 for both streets and both parameters. Slightly better results were seen for shaded locations over those in full sun.

After TARGET has been shown to be a suitable tool, the second aim proceeded to quantify the HTC cooling potentials of WSUD. Using four different WSUD scenarios (representing increasing levels of WSUD infrastructure interventions) under three different 3 day climate scenarios (cool, average, and extreme summer periods), results from the twelve were analysed. When results were averaged across the entire 3 day time period across the entire suburb, only small differences were found. Air temperatures only differed by 0.01 to 0.04\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}, with the larger differences seen with the cool climate scenario. However, in averaging the entire suburb at the hottest part of the modelling period (2 pm on the 3rd day), larger air temperature differences were seen, ranging from 0.01 to 0.2\SI{}{\degreeCelsius}. At this single point in time, more cooling was seen from the extreme and average climate scenarios over the cool scenarios.
 
Further scenarios explored the differences between the different land cover classes (road, concrete, dry grass, irrigated grass, vegetation, and water bodies) by running each in isolation. Under extreme weather conditions, the differences in air temperature between the land cover classes were much smaller than under cool conditions. We hypothesise that in extreme conditions, all of the surfaces are overwhelmed by heat.

Averaging results across the entire suburb is not necessarily representative of what somebody living in the suburb would experience day to day, so the last set of results only focused on a small representative area of interest (AOI). The cooling effects were seen to be much more pronounced when the less relevant portions of the suburb were excluded. Averages of air temperature reductions across the 3 day period across the AOI again repeated the pattern seen of larger cooling magnitudes under the cool scenario than the extreme, with Scenario 4 delivering 0.51, 0.40, and 0.31\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} of air temperature reductions for the cool, average, and extreme scenarios respectively. When looking at the average temperature reduction across the AOI at the hottest part of the modelling period (2 pm on the 3rd day), the cooling becomes more pronounced with cooling of 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} for the three climate scenarios respectively.

Larger reductions were expected in the AOI over the entire suburb because the WSUD interventions were largely concentrated in the residential zones rather than the surrounding grasslands. The differences between averaging across the 3 day modelling period and comparing the hottest point highlight that in terms of air temperature, WSUD interventions have little effect at night.

When looking at the HTC impacts of WSUD interventions (as measured by UTCI), the cooling potentials become more substantial. This is where the interventions have a stronger impact on \glssymbol{Tmrt} (an important component of UTCI, creating cooler surfaces. Reductions with Scenario 4 at the hottest part of the modelling period (2 pm on the 3rd day) achieve reductions in UTCI of 2.1, 1.2 and 1.0\SI{}{\degreeCelsius} for the cool, average, and extreme scenarios respectively. 

\textbf{TODO draw some more conclusions.}
