Introduction
-Urban heat, a bad thing
-CSUD/WSUD proposed for urban cooling
-TARGET tool
--What is the potential for WSUD/CSUD for urban cooling and positive impacts on HTC at a precinct and micro-climate scale?
--What are the economic impacts of this cooling?

Methods
1) Adding UTCI to TARGET
1a) add a validation of the UTCI stuff using George/Gipps St.
2) WSUD scenarios
3) Climate scenarios
4) Representative urban portions
5) Economics

Results
-UTCI works good
-Lots of scenario results

Discussion
- Very little Tair cooling at wide scale.
- Most effective during cool days
- Large variations in land classes
- Cooling very localized, so look at representative portions.
- Better cooling at this scale
- Again, best cooling with cool and then average
- No cooling at night
- HTC cooling more substantial
- But also repeats best with cool and average days
- In economics? What are the results and what does it mean?

Conclusion
